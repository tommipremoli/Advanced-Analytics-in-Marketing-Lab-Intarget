# Advanced Analytics in Marketing Lab - Intarget
This project builds a data-driven attribution model to assign credit to marketing channels for conversions, using a 30-day attribution window. It compares this model with the Last Click model, which gives 100% credit to the final channel. DDA distributes credit more evenly, accounting for all channels involved in customer acquisition.

# Advanced Analytics in Marketing Lab - Intarget
This project, realised during a university lab in collaboration with Intarget, develops a data-driven attribution model to assign credit to marketing channels that generate conversions, using a 30-day attribution window. The model is compared to the Last Click, which allocates 100% of the credit to the last channel used. The DDA model distributes credit more fairly, considering the actual contribution of all channels involved, including sources such as display and paid search, which are often underestimated in the Last Click model.
